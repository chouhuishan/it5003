# Plagiarism Policy:
# 
# Associate Professor Steven Halim provides this implementation of classic sorting algorithms
# for his classes in National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC).
# 
# This code is supposed to be studied by his students to understand the technical details
# of the implementation of several classic sorting algorithms.
# 
# His style is to test his students on "application" of these algorithms,
# not about re-inventing these classic sorting algorithms again and again,
# thus his assignments and tests rarely ask students to reuse this code verbatim.
# (anyway, you can always use list.sort() or sorted(list) to do the same).
#
# If you arrive at this source code from another module that is still testing you on how
# to (re)-implement these classic sorting algorithms (and grade you for that), note that you can still
# use this code below, but at your own risk, as you may be accidentally flagged as
# commiting plagiarism if your other classmates do the same.
